# Python-Hangman-Game
My first Python project - A classic Hangman game built while learning the basics of the language.
Hangman Game 🎮
A classic, interactive Hangman game built with Python. This project was created as part of my journey to master Python logic and data structures.

📝 Description
In this game, the computer selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess it one letter at a time. Be careful – too many wrong guesses and the game is over!

✨ Features
Dynamic Word Selection: Randomly chooses words for every new game.

Visual Feedback: Displays the hidden word with underscores and updates in real-time.

Input Validation: Handles duplicate guesses and non-alphabetic characters.

Simple & Clean: Pure Python implementation without external dependencies.

🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Download the hangman.py file.

Open your terminal/CMD and run:
python hangman.py


🧠 What I Learned
Working with the random module.

Using while loops and complex if-else logic.

String manipulation and list indexing.

Managing user input and game states.
